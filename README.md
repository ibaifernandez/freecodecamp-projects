# freecodecamp-projects

As part of the Responsive Web Design Certification at FreeCodeCamp.org, these are my 5 first HTML-CSS projects.

[**1. A tribute page on Charles Bukowski**](https://ibaifernandez.github.io/freecodecamp-projects/tribute-page/index.html)

With this design, I had my first contact with HTML and CSS working with CSS Box and learning to `float` elements.

[**2. A survey form**](https://ibaifernandez.github.io/freecodecamp-projects/survey-form/index.html)

With this design, I learned about HTML forms and CSS Flex, as well as animating backgrounds and styling HTML form's elements.

[**3. A landing page**](https://ibaifernandez.github.io/freecodecamp-projects/landing-page/index.html)

With this design, I deepened in CSS Flex Box and relative units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax) as well as CSS animations.

[**4. A documentation page**](https://ibaifernandez.github.io/freecodecamp-projects/documentation-page/index.html)

With this design, I deepened in CSS positioning.

[**5. A portfolio site**](https://ibaifernandez.github.io/freecodecamp-projects)

With this design, I brought together all I'd learnt so far.
